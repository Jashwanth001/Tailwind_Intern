                        loaded with
                        lot of contrarian feelings- you need the person you love to be possessive about you
                        yet you
                        need your space; you need that person to respect your thoughts and let you do things
                        on
                        your own course yet you want that person to offer their unsolicited views, and I
                        could
                        go on and on about how this universal feeling called "LOVE" is so unfathomable and
                        complex. Perhaps, this is why, no matter how many movies are made around the central
                        theme of love, new ones with fresher perspective like "Lover" still are celebrated

                        it's
                        form and severity may vary. Some crisis could impact self while some like Covid 19 could impact
                        people at large. Darwin's theory of evolution talks about survival of the fittest, which
                        emphasizes on the adaptablity to the adverse situations as a quintessential quality to live to
                        see another day. This theory is very much and all the more relevant in present scenario given
                        the VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) nature of the world. But what are the
                        essential qualities, you may wonder. Thanks to the authors T N Hari and Sanjay Swami, who are
                        eminent personalities in the entrepreneurial ecosystem in India, for they have shared their
                        collective wisdom in the form of their book 'Sailing through a storm-Making crisis work for
                        you', which helps us understand these qualities through the inspiring lives of men and women who
                        had confronted major crisis, with equanimity and fortitude. All are real-life stories, including
                        their personal experiences and that of illustrious people, most of whom are least heard of and
                        had stayed away from the proverbial limelight.</p>

                        friends, or colleagues etc., Any contact between two humans has got lot of intricacies and
                        nuances. But nothing can beat the complexity more than a relationship that blossoms between a
                        man and a woman who intends to share their life with each other. Given its complexity, capturing
                        it in truest sense and realistically is quite a challenge for anyone as there is nothing black
                        or white about 'Love', it's always in the grey!! The challenge lies in bringing out the inner
                        emotions including the ambiguities and uncertainties in the minds of the characters who are
                        portrayed to be in love. When it comes to authors, I always felt Somerset Maugham stands out in
                        beautifully showcasing the vulnerabilities of the lovers. He goes to such depths so as to
                        capture even the minutest of emotions in detail. For instance, his stories would narrate how
                        stealthily they yearn to meet each other and verbalises the hard emotions that even the person
                        undergoing them can't express in words.</p>

                        that the couple should still lead their lives on (beautiful yet complicated) Earth!! All of us

                        would support, defend, and handhold us in this journey. But very rarely do we come across
                        couples who have achieved this stature. This book 'Row, Row, Row your Boat' is a book written by
                        couple therapists, Sophia and Roopak(a couple themselves!!), who turned around their married
                        life which was on the verge of collapse with therapy's help. This is a short but insightful read
                        on little things that couples could do 'together' to reach their vision of becoming a
                        made-for-each-other couple, which apparently was their original vow when they got married but
                        may have fizzled out as years passed by.</p>

                        working in a reputed organization and your appraisal is underway. You have high hopes of getting
                        a sizeable increment with a promotion to a leadership role. All of a sudden, your manager
                        invites you into his room and asks you to poach some information to a competitor firm for some
                        illegal commission. Would you be okay doing this so that your appraisal sails through, which
                        will also keep you in your manager's good books or would you back off as you would be hurting
                        the organization for illegal short term again. This is just an example of one of plethora of
                        daily dilemmas that life throws at you with varying complexities. This book by Hardayal Singh, a
                        civil service Officer, attempts to highlight through fictional and real stories of common men,
                        that choosing and walking along the righteous path with an unwavering mind is possible but
                        acknowledges that it is extremely difficult. Through these stories, the readers will get to
                        understand that though the path has no or little trail, when one looks back one will feel
                        satisfied for having left a trail, serving as a guiding light for fellow men. More importantly,

                    <p>Hello! Welcome to Sammy's MindChirps. I'm glad you are here. To me, the word LIFE is
                        an acronym
                        of Laboratory with Infinite Freedom to Experiment. It's more like a kaleidoscope offering
                        amazing learning opportunities as we grow and explore various facets of life. So this blog is a
                        platform where I share anything that I find interesting (with my two cents, of course :D). I
                        assure that you will have some new learning when you exit the blog. And do share your feeback on
                        the blog or anything you want me to write about in this blog by dropping an email to
                        mindchirps@gmail.com</p>
